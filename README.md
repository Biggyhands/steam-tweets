# steam-tweets

This project was developed as part of a technical assessment for a Frontend Developer position. It leverages Next.js to create a simplified, Steam-inspired web application.

## About Steam-Tweets

Steam-Tweets is a mock-up website that simulates a user browsing experience inspired by the Steam platform. Key features include:

- **User Search:** Allows users to search for other users within the application.
- **Profile Overview:** Provides access to simulated user profiles, displaying relevant information.
- **"Activity Feed" (Posts):** Mimics Steam's "Activity" feed, showcasing user-generated content retrieved from the JSONPlaceholder API. This content simulates posts or updates from users.

**❗❗Important Disclaimer:❗❗** Steam-Tweets is an _unofficial_ tribute to the Steam platform. As a fan project, it replicates certain aspects of Steam's design and functionality for demonstration purposes only. I, as the developer, do _NOT_ own any of the assets, trademarks, or styles inspired by the Steam platform. All rights belong to their respective owners.
